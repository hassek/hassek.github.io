# About

As a programmer I choose Python as my weapon of choice and I love programming in it, Although I am very open to other technologies. I like to be part of everything in an application. Automation, Server Maintenance, Front End, Back End, anything that means something interesting, new or challenging.

Also I consider myself a startup person, the idea of being able to greatly influence a product, the multiple hat approach, to trust everyone is a responsible self motivated co-worker, etc. It's what I love about the startup life.

I am in love with the _vim_ editor and using it together with _tmux_, is a very productive combo to work with.
